#+TITLE: org-pretty-jump

org-pretty-jump is a simple Emacs that provides an ivy-based (we might support helm in the future) menu for easily navigating org-mode buffers.
It provides API functions for creating actions based on the menu, as well as some predefined end-user commands.

This package is highly unstable.
If you still would like to use it, please read the elisp source carefully and make sure to only manually update the package.
